# Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms
In this Project, the following Machine Learning algorithms were Benchmarked:

- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Random Forest

This was completed using a Predict Loan Eligibility for Dream Housing Finance company dataset.

To begin, the dataset was explored, and it was found that there were missing values in many features.

Next, the dataset was split into Training and Testing data, where 10% of the data is place in the Testing field.
