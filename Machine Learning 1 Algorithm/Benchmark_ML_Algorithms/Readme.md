# Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms
In this Project, the following Machine Learning algorithms were Benchmarked:

- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Random Forest

This was completed using a Predict Loan Eligibility for Dream Housing Finance company dataset.

To begin, the dataset was explored, and it was found that there were missing values in many features.

Therefore, all rows with any missing values were taken out from the dataset.

Next, multiple features have Nonnumerical values. Therefore, Label Encoder was used to assign them numerical values.

Next, the dataset was split into Training and Testing data, where 10% of the data is place in the Testing field.

 Finally, all the previously mentioned Machine Learning Algorithms were tested to obtain an Accuracy.

Therefore, the best accuracy for this dataset was found to be Naive Bayes.
