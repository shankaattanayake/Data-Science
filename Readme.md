# Shanka Attanayake - Data Science Projects Portfolio

Hello! 

My name is Shanka Attanayake. I did my undergraduate at Ryerson University where I majored in Mechanical Engineering, specialized in Mechatronics. In my undergraduate studies I spent a lot of time creating robotic projects. While I was able to program robotics designs using microcontrollers, I wanted to better my software skills. This is how I found my passion for data science. I started my post graduate studies enrolling in the Applied A.I. Solutions Development at George Brown College in 2021 (https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/applied-ai-solutions-development-program-t431) in the pursuit of becoming a Full Stack Data Scientist. The idea is to be qualified in the Data Analyst, Engineering and Scientist roles while being able to work with/present to technical, business and investors partners.
